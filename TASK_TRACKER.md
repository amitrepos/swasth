## MODULE A — Core Architecture + Auth + Profiles

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| A1 | Phone OTP login | 🔄 Partial | Email + password + JWT only. Phone number collected at registration but unused for auth. OTP used only for password reset. No Firebase phone OTP. |
| A2 | Multi-profile data model | ✅ Done | Full backend: profiles, profile_access, profile_invites tables. All 22 steps complete. |
| A3 | Profile creation | ✅ Done | `create_profile_screen.dart` — name, age, gender, height, blood group, conditions, medications. |
| A4 | Medication list | ✅ Done | Current medications text field in profile creation + edit. |
| A5 | "Add person without smartphone" | ✅ Done | Create profile for someone else → caller becomes "owner". `create_profile_screen.dart`. |

## NEXT PRIORITIES (Bihar Pilot)

### P0 — Safety Critical
- **D7** — Abnormal value alert: when CRITICAL reading saved, immediately notify family (WhatsApp or push)
- **D8** — WhatsApp Business API: register with Meta/Twilio — 2–5 day approval wait, start NOW

### P0 — Usability
- **A12** — First-time onboarding: welcome → create profile → how to photograph → invite family
- **A9** — Offline mode: `hive` or `sqflite` cache for health readings + sync queue (Bihar connectivity)

### P1 — Quick wins (< 1 day each)
- **C3** — BMI: height in profile already, add weight reading + display BMI on profile screen
- **B11** — Reading reminders: `flutter_local_notifications` — daily nudge if no reading by 8pm
- **D2** — Morning tip: extend AI Doctor to time-gate a morning recommendation

### P1 — Medium effort
- **B18** — Armband: implement actual step/heart rate BLE parsing
- **A12** — Onboarding carousel (3–4 screens)
- **D13** — FCM setup for push alerts (prerequisite for D7 fallback)
